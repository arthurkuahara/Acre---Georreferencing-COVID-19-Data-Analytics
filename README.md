# Acre - Georreferencing COVID-19 Data Analytics

This repository stores info from a research that I'm a part of by the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) COVID-19 Data Analytics, mentored by prof. Wagner Meira Jr.
Currently, we're finding a way to plot tweets and interesting info onto an interactive map where users can learn more about the COVID-19 pandemic.
